# Environmental Sensor Node with LoRa Communication

This project implements an environmental sensor node using Arduino, various sensors, and LoRa communication. The node collects data on temperature, humidity, light intensity, soil moisture, and battery voltage, then transmits this data using LoRa.

## Hardware Requirements

- Arduino board (compatible with used libraries)
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- BH1750 light sensor
- Soil moisture sensor
- LoRa module (e.g., RFM95)
- Battery for power supply

## Software Dependencies

This project requires the following libraries:

- DHT sensor library for Arduino
- Adafruit Unified Sensor
- BH1750
- LowPower
- LoRa

Ensure these are installed in your Arduino IDE before compiling the code.

## Pin Configuration

- DHT11 sensor: Pin 8
- Soil moisture sensor data: Pin A0
- Soil moisture sensor power: Pin 7
- Battery voltage measurement: Pin A1
- LoRa module: Depends on your specific module, typically uses SPI pins

## Functionality

1. The device initializes all sensors and the LoRa module.
2. It then enters a loop of:
   - Waking up and reinitializing LoRa
   - Reading sensor data
   - Transmitting data via LoRa
   - Entering a low-power sleep mode

## Message Format

The LoRa message is formatted as follows:
##NETWORK_ID@ENVSENSOR@NODE_ID:SEQUENCE:TIMESTAMP@TEMP;HUMIDITY;LIGHT;SOIL@BATTERY@CHECKSUM$$

- `##`: Start delimiter
- `NETWORK_ID`: Identifier for the network (e.g., "ALPHA1")
- `ENVSENSOR`: Message type identifier
- `NODE_ID`: Unique identifier for this sensor node
- `SEQUENCE`: Message sequence number
- `TIMESTAMP`: Current timestamp (milliseconds since boot)
- `TEMP`: Temperature reading (Â°C)
- `HUMIDITY`: Humidity reading (%)
- `LIGHT`: Light intensity (lux)
- `SOIL`: Soil moisture reading (V)
- `BATTERY`: Battery voltage (V)
- `CHECKSUM`: Hexadecimal checksum of the message
- `$$`: End delimiter

Example:
##ALPHA1@ENVSENSOR@0002:10:5000@24.50;53.20;216.33;0.89@3.70@a08$$

To parse this message:
1. Split the message by `@` characters
2. Further split the third part (after `ENVSENSOR`) by `:` to get node info
3. Split the fourth part by `;` to get environmental sensor readings
4. The fifth part contains the battery voltage
5. Everything between `##` and `$$` should be used to verify the checksum

## Setup and Installation

1. Connect all sensors and the LoRa module to your Arduino board according to the pin configuration.
2. Install all required libraries in your Arduino IDE.
3. Copy the provided code into your Arduino IDE.
4. Adjust any necessary parameters (e.g., `NETWORK_ID`, `ID`, `LORA_FREQUENCY`).
5. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

Once set up and powered on, the device will automatically begin its sensing and transmission cycle. Use a LoRa receiver to capture and decode the transmitted messages.

## Power Management

The device uses low-power sleep modes to conserve energy. It sleeps for approximately 15 minutes between readings (adjustable via `SLEEP_CYCLES`).

## Troubleshooting

- If sensors fail to initialize, the built-in LED will blink rapidly.
- Enable `DEBUG` mode for verbose serial output to diagnose issues.
- Ensure all connections are secure and power supply is adequate.
- Verify that the LoRa frequency matches your regional regulations.
